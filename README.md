This Repo exists because the certificate at the official site has expired, and https links no longer get served securely. This makes it impossible to use the font in [CodePen](https://www.codepen.io), as they have recently switched from HTTP/HTTPS to HTTPS.


### Usage

##### Include it in your project

you can use either `blokkfont.css` for the rawgit links or use `blokkfont_original.css` for including the font straight from [BlokkFont](http://www.blokkfont.com/), the base URL is the same. Be aware that `blokkfont_original.css` does not serve as HTTPS.
```
<link href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/octoshrimpy/blokkfont/9e89c548/blokkfont.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```

```
@import url("https://blokkfont-losgordos.netdna-ssl.com/v2/blokkfont.css");
```


##### Use it!

font-family: "BLOKK";
```
